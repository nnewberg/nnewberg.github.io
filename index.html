          From one small town which had no name<br>
          &emsp;A young man did embark<br>
        Aboard a merchant trading ship<br>
          &emsp;For lands both lush and stark.<br><br>

        The man had never traveled far<br>
        &emsp;Beyond his humble home,<br>
         So awed and wonderstruck was he<br>
         &emsp;As ‘round the world he roamed.<br><br>

         But as the man traversed the globe,<br>
         &emsp;He had a creeping fear<br>
         That each new place would slowly seem<br>
         &emsp;Repetitive and drear.<br><br>

         Thus every time the ship would dock,<br>
         &emsp;The young man would alight<br>
         To gather keepsakes that recall<br>
         &emsp;The wondrous sounds and sights.<br><br>

         His large collection soon outgrew<br>
         &emsp;His narrow sleeping quarters,<br>
         So secretly he stowed it in<br>
         &emsp;One of the ship’s containers.

        This box was numbered 83<br>
        &emsp;And was the man’s great pride,<br>
        So hesitant at first was he<br>
        &emsp;To let people inside.<br><br>

        But over time, the man began<br>
        &emsp;To welcome guests——though few——<br>
        To have a drink inside this box<br>
        &emsp;With friends and strangers, too.<br><br>

        In plain sight now the box is hid<br>
        &emsp;Disguised in camouflage,<br>
        So only those with piercing eyes<br>
        &emsp;Discern Tiki Mirage.<br><br>

        Where Daniel Coleridge is today<br>
        &emsp;No man can say for certain,<br>
        But still some guests are asked to peek<br>
        &emsp;Behind the bamboo curtain.<br><br>

        To you, Dear Reader, thus I give<br>
        &emsp;A special invitation:<br>

        &emsp;For tasty, sweet libations.
