There once was a place hidden deep under the sea, where all manner of the ocean’s most mythic denizens—shipwrecked pirates, Polynesian princes, mermaids and all—would seek serene escape from the ocean’s tempestuous waters and commune over exotic and colorful libations. A spate of untamed tides sent this most sacred place farther down into the ocean’s depths than any sane soul would ever dare try to reach. For countless years, this place was deemed lost forever—until one day, a brave sea explorer stumbled upon it and brought it ashore. Dazzled by its seemingly magical ability to melt away the social divisions that would otherwise separate pirate from prince or mermaid from man, the explorer knew he must treat his discovery with great care. On the mainland, he kept it hidden in plain sight and shared it with only a few of his most trusted compatriots. Although still cloaked in the guise of the ordinary and everyday, few have been lucky enough to be granted access. Today, you have been chosen to join us in Luau at Tiki Mirage.      	<br><br>
      	September 6th and 7th<br>at an undisclosed location in Los Angeles, CA<br>
      	By invitation only
