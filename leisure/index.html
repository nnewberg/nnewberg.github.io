Many years ago and many leagues under the sea was a place where shipwrecked pirates, Polynesian princes, mermaids and all who had heard its legendary tales sought serene escape from the harsh waters, good company and exotic intoxicating potions. A spout of untamed tides sent this place farther into the depths than any sane soul could reach.  Lost for countless years, a brave sea explorer once stumbled upon this gem and brought it ashore. Dazzled by its seemingly magical ability to melt away even the slightest of stresses of its inhabitants, the explorer knew he must treat his discovery with great care. Although cloaked under the guise of the ordinary and everyday, few have been lucky enough to be granted access. Today, you have been chosen to join us in Luau.	</center>
