Many years ago and many leagues under the sea was a place where shipwrecked pirates, Polynesian princes, mermaids and all who had heard its legendary tales sought serene escape from the harsh waters, good company and exotic intoxicating potions. A spout of untamed tides sent this place farther into the depths than any good soul could reach.  Lost for countless years, a brave sea explorer once stumbled upon this gem and brought it ashore.
